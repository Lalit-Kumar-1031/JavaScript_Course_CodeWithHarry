             String is a data type that is used to store text data like your name ,address ect.
             
             String can be store in two format 1) with doble quote 2) With single quote
    
             Ex- for string both syntax are correct.    
             let name="Lalit";
             let address='Budaun'; 
    
            Template Literals :- 
            
            template literals are same as string but template literals are used backtick (``)instead of quotes.
             
           ***
            In a template literal,you can put the variable and compiler combined that variable value into 
            template literal that process is called string interpolation.
            
            let name="Lalit";
            let friend='Tarun';
    
           let sentance=`${name} is a friend of ${friend}`;
           document.write(sentance);
    
           also you can put single,double quote into template literals,like this.
           let sentance=`Lalit 'is' a "friend" of Tarun`;
           
           document.write(sentance);
         
          Output :- Lalit 'is' a "friend" of Tarun
    
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
           let name="Lalit";
           let friend='Tarun';
    
           let sentance=`${name} is "a' friend of ${friend}`;
           document.write(sentance);

    Escape Sequence Character :- these character provide unique facility in a string.
    
    Q.1 how you can add single quote as a character in single quote string.
    
    let fruit='bana'na'; //it give an error
    document.write(fruit);
    
    this give a error so how you can do this.
    You can do this by using Escape sequence character.
    
    let fruit='bana\'na';   //Now its print with single quote.
    document.write(fruit);
    
   Note :- 
   same concept are follow for double quote string.
   let fruit="bana\"na";
    
   Note :- 
   Escape Sequence Character have two character(\') but treat as a single character and also its length is 1.
    
    Some Escape Sequence Character :-
    
    1)\' put single quote into single quote string
    2)\" put double quote into double code string
    3)\n new linw
    4)\r carriage return
    5)\t tab
    
             */
            
            let fruit='bana\'na';
            let fruit2="bana\"na";
            document.write(fruit);
            document.write(fruit2);
